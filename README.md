DI Digital Platform Datamart
============================

This is a repository for storing (and working with) the data that will be used in the first iteration of the new DI "country profiles" (NB. that there is ingoing discussion as to what this 'thing' should be called: we might first work on country-based data but it's bigger than that).

All data and related indexes are being stored in csv format.

There are currently three data workspaces:

reference-data:
- an index of reference datasets
- reference datasets (named r000.csv) - with no fixed format

country-data:
- an index of datasets
- an index of dimensions
- country datasets (named c0000.csv)  - all in the normalised format of country-id, year, dimension, value

work-in-progress:
- various wip data
