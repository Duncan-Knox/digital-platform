This is the interface to the Data Warehouse

It consists of a small node app to import data from postgres to the local csv files you will find in this repo.

Hence most of the files previously stored here can be considered generated by this app and the csv filesa here are simply cached versions.

To use :

First get a recent version of node (harder than it sounds), the easiest way is to use NVM - https://github.com/creationix/nvm

	curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash
	nvm install stable

then install the node dependencies

	npm install

then you can run the importer code

	./warehouse import


Notes.
======

Data Warehouse or DW is the postgres database.
Digital Platform or DP is the collection of csv files.
