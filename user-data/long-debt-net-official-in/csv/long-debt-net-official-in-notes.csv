"To avoid double counting disbursments on ODA loans and OOFs are removed from the reported disbursements of long-term debt from official creditors. ODA loans are subtracted from disbursements of concessional debt to each country; OOFs are subtracted from non-concessional sources (distinguishing between bilateral and multilateral providers in both calculations). Any negative values, where reported disbursements of ODA loans or OOFs exceed reported disbursements of long-term debt, are set to zero."
